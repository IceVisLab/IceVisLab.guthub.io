## General
### Working Hours
The lab is quite big on independence and flexibility – do your work for around 40 hours a week (or however many hours is in your contract), show up to lab meetings and check in with your PI from time to time. As long as you get your work done (and hopefully feel fulfilled doing it!), then how/where/when you do this is up to you (unless it comes to running participants, then you perhaps should consider opening times/slots for the experiment rooms being free, and the availability of your lab rats).

### Lab Meetings
As mentioned above, showing up for lab meetings is important. Because of this, it’s perhaps useful to know when and where they are… **Wednesdays** at **10:30** in room **N120** (Bókastofa Sálfræðideildar), located on the first floor as you enter the building.

For an idea of upcoming presentations in the lab meetings, we also have an open-for-editing [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SKEzrhTsw0zt-vZgYq-SRP9Z6b7BT7uwjNGDRN9nPw4/edit#gid=0)

If you find yourself unable to attend in person, you can also join with the following zoom meeting ID – **695 1289 6619**.

### Presentations
Present your work! And if you don’t have work to show at the moment, present something which is interesting to you. We’re all vision scientists/geeks and we want to know these things – this is why we are here!

### Collaborative Attitude
We all have a unique approach and perspective - each contribution is part of making science more open and collaborative. Together we can be one big bubble of vision-related-expertise and greatness. So if you are wondering about research in a certain area, have a potential pothole which is open to further investigation… say! If you have any ideas about how we can improve things in the lab, also say! Or email, or leave a note... whatever floats your boat. This wiki is open for editing, so you could pop it in here too. The lab manual was heavily inspired by existing manuals, particularly [this one](https://github.com/alylab/labmanual), and [this one](https://metacoglab.github.io/lab_wiki/). There’s also a really nice article in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06167-w) which goes through the importance of lab manuals and how to make one, should you be curious.

### Lab Ettiquette
Be mindful of one another! Respect others’ opinions and beliefs, be open to one another and inclusive regardless of gender, sexual orientation, nationality, race, appearance and so on. If you feel like you haven’t been respected in the workplace and would like to talk about it, then talk to your PI about it. If you feel that your PI is the person who hasn’t respected you, then contact X.


## Not-so-General
### Principal Investigators (PIs)
- **Keep an eye on your minions.** This means checking in with them from time to time. It could be an idea to schedule a weekly/fortnightly meeting with each individual minion just to check up on them (scientifically, emotionally, career and otherwise)
- Give feedback etc. on a timely basis
- Apply for funding
- Keep the minions up to speed with what is currently happening in the lab, future directions of the lab and developments in the field

### Post-Doctoral Researchers
- AKA post-docs (this is just got a better ring to it and is more fun/ghetto, but I don’t know if it’s offensive to write ‘post-docs, as they are known in the ghetto’)
- To be quite **independent** when it comes to conducting your own line of research
- Present your findings from time to time, keep other lab members/minions in the loop with how your research is going
- Help out students and fellow minions
- Apply for funding, particularly if you wish to extend the length of your post-doc
- Have candy for their PI (particularly if that PI is Heiða

### Graduate/PHD Students
- Develop the research for your thesis
- Be aware of deadlines and stick to them. If you're unsure about anything, contact your PI
- Supervise undergraduate students, whether it be with data collection, write-ups and so on
- Present your work and direction! Keep other minions in the loop with what you are doing
- Apply for funding – not only is it good practice (it’s a key part of work in this field), but chances are you will need to extend the length of your PHD and you need funding for this.
- Soul search! Think about what type of career you would like to pursue, whether you’d like to stay in academia (teaching, research) or branch out into other fields

### Lab Managers
- Patiently awaiting response from Ómar on his percieved responsilities

### EEG Research and Technical Assistants
- Assist with EEG data collection
- Help-out with coding of experiments, data analyses, wikis etc.

### Undergraduate Students
- Assist other lab members with data collection adn analysis
