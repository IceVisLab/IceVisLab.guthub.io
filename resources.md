## Website
First and foremost, we have a website! On here you can find information about the team, research we are doing, publications and other resources.

## Twitter
Useful for research updates in the vision lab and the field more generally.

## Slack
For the more underground lab-related business, we have a slack! From this, you can join the channels that are relevant to you. At the time of writing, the most active channels are the general, lab meeting channels â€“ but check out the others! Maybe you see one you quite like, or maybe you get hit with a flash of inspiration to start another, or maybe nothing happens at all... who knows.
