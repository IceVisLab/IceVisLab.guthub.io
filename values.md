## Scientific Integrity
### Research Conduct
There is quite a nice resource here which covers experimental protocols, research ethics, how to care for participants, as well as data collection, analysis and sharing. 

No fabrication, falsification or plagiarism.

Think about the overall scientific goal â€“ to arrive at the truth/base of a conundrum and deepen our understanding of the brain and behaviour, particularly with regards to visual perception.


### Reproductible Data
If someone takes your raw data that you have shared in the name of open science, they should be able to reproduce your results exactly. Think of it as a statistical peer-review â€“ if the results are not reproducible then it suggests there has been a mistake somewhere along the way. In terms of conduct, it is also a good idea to give an analysis pipeline, from pre-processing, to running models, to statistical tests, and whatever else you think might be relevant. This can also be included as comments in your code (#python %matlab ðŸ˜Ž)

While we are at it, it also helps to have a standardised system for naming your data, just so itâ€™s easier for others to navigate it and helps keep things organised, especially on GIThub. Sarah is currently trying to work out how to do this, likely following the [BIDS framework](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or some adaptation of it that also covers behavioural data.

### Authorship
Like other labs, we will follow the APA guidelines with respect to authorship:

"Authorship credit should reflect the individual's contribution to the study. An author is considered anyone involved with initial research design, data collection and analysis, manuscript drafting, and final approval. However, the following do not necessarily qualify for authorship: providing funding or resources, mentorship, or contributing research but not helping with the publication itself. The primary author assumes responsibility for the publication, making sure that the data are accurate, that all deserving authors have been credited, that all authors have given their approval to the final draft; and handles responses to inquiries after the manuscript is published."

The first author is whoever is taking on the lead role of the study.

### Confidentiality
Before we get going on anything with participants, we sign an agreement which in essence states that we respect the confidentiality of health-related and personal information with regards to subjects. To breach this is breaking the law with regards to the Protection and Processing of Personal Data (and itâ€™s just not cool and very unprofessional... so donâ€™t do it!)
