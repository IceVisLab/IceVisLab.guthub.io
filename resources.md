## Website
First and foremost, we have a website! On here you can find information about the team, research we are doing, publications and other resources.

## Twitter
Useful for research updates in the vision lab and the field more generally.

## Slack
For the more underground lab-related business, we have a slack! From this, you can join the channels that are relevant to you. At the time of writing, the most active channels are the general, lab meeting channels – but check out the others! Maybe you see one you quite like, or maybe you get hit with a flash of inspiration to start another, or maybe nothing happens at all... who knows.

## Equipment
Our research labs are located in the building behind us named Oddi. You’ll find our labs in the basement (of course... where else?), with the following equipment: (paitently awaiting response from Ómar)

There is also this nice floor plan, showing our labs located in the basement of Oddi.

### Lab Rules 
When you find yourself in the lab using the equipment, keep the following in mind:
-	Do not change the settings for the computers. You can however connect and disconnect equipment which is necessary for your experiment
-	Do not install any software on the computers without confirming it first with our wonderful lab manager Ómar (omarjo@hi.is). This includes any drivers that may be necessary to run software.
-	When booking the labs, remain aware of your fellow minions and that they might need to use the space too! Hogging isn’t cool.
-	If it becomes apparent that your lab rat cannot attend, or something of a similar calibre that means the slot cannot be used, cancel it ASAP. Even if you get stood up for the booking, still cancel it! (Afterwards maybe consulting your fellow minions so they can provide all the necessary emotional support, wiping away of your tears, pep talks, etc.)
-	Data collection reigns supreme! If a fellow minion is with a participant, then wait until the lab is empty before testing your experiment, setting up equipment, screaming etc.
-	Keep the labs clean, organised, locked when not in use, light off when you leave, all that jazz
-	Take the keys out of the key holder only when necessary, make sure the key holder is closed, the code at 0000 and so on.
-	No food and drink next to the equipment
-	And an extra special rule for our snazzy sound booth – no shoes when in there!
